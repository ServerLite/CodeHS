# While Loops

> While loops allows the developer to keep running a block of code until the condition is 'False'

CONDITION >> Must result into a Boolean
CODE >> Your code that you want to execute

``` Java
while ( CONDITION ) {
	CODE;
};
```

#### EXAMPLE

``` Java

int i = 0; // Integer Variable for while loop
while (i < 10) {
	System.out.println(i); // Printing the 'i' value
	i--; // Decrementing the 'i' value by 1
};

```
