Why do we use if statements in Java?

> To break out of some block of code.
-- This statement is incorrect because it uses the 'break' command from within a looping expression.

> To do something only if the condition is true. << Correct
-- This statement is correct because it checks 'IF' the condition is true

> To do something while a condition is true.
-- This statement is incorrect because this requires the 'WHILE' loop for this to be true.

> To repeat something for a fixed number of times.
-- this statement is incorrect because it reqires the 'FOR' loop for this to be true.

Which if statement is written proper?
> if (boolean expression):
    // code to execute
   
   -- This statement is incorrect because we need to have a parenthesis around the boolean expression 
   AND we need to have curly braces for our block of code
   
   
> if boolean expression
  {
    // code to execute
  }
  
  -- This statement is in incorrect because we need to have parenthesis around the boolean expression


> if (boolean expression)   << Correct
	{
		// code to execute
	}
	
	-- This statement is correct because all syntax requirements are accepted
	
> if (boolean expression)
	[
		// code to execute
	]
	
	-- This statement is incorrect because we need curly braces to contain our code, NOT square brackets.
