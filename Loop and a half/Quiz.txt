Which statement can we use inside of a loop to end it?

> System.out.println;
-- This statement is incorrect because it is a function and it outputs text to the console.

> break;        << Correct
-- This statement is correct because this allows us to break out of loops

> SENTINEL;
-- This statement is incorrect because this is a made-up syntax. (Personally, never seen this. :( )

> else
-- this statement is incorrect because this is used for if statements.

Which of the following is correct loop and a half structure?

>	while (condition)
	{
		// code
	}
	
	-- This statement is incorrect because, yes it does create a proper while loop, but there is not break statement for this quiz.
	
>	while (true)         << correct
	{
		if (condition)
		{
			break;
		}
		// code
	}
	-- This statement is correct because if contains while loop and a break statement
	
	
>	for (int i = 0; i < 1.5; i++)
	{
		// code
	}
	
	-- This statement is incorrect because this is a for loop
	
>	for (int i = 0; i < 2; i++)
	{
		// code
		break;
		// code
	}
	
	-- This statement is incorrect because this is a for loop and the first code would only run because it would just break before the second code could run.
